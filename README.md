## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

This is my first attempt on making a ReactJS project and I've learned a lot especially with managing components and states. I've also learned how to use React Bootstrap as well as using a build tool like Vite. 

### Useful resources

- [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) - This helped me with the concepts on ReactJS such as creating components and managing state and props.
- [React Bootstrap Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pKjULHzs0s) - This is a tutorial on using React Bootstrap, though I already have previous knowledge on using Bootstrap, this helped me a lot with how to integrate Bootstrap on React.
- [How To Import Images Dynamically In React With Vite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EFZIe_Cpv8) - This helped me with the steps on using the import.meta.url feature to dynamically import the static images.
